Breakdown of work:
Luis:
1. Got the delete function to work
2. Changed how id assignment functions in create to stop the same id from being assigned to multiple reminders. 
3. Fixed bug in update, completed was receiving string value, expecting a boolean
4. Fixed bug in delete function. Deleted based off of position in reminders list, not reminderID. Baffled previous version worked. 

Kassel Leano:
1. Update function: This function updates existing reminders (title, description, complete status)
